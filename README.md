# Chemical Compound Bioactivity Classification
## Implemented a model using the NCI109 dataset in classifying 4,127 chemical compounds as active or inactive against cancer cell lines
## Extracted graphlet-based features, performed random walks, and used the skip-gram architecture to construct the feature embeddings 
## Compared Graph Convolutional Network & DNN to achieve 70% accuracy, visualized results with NetworkX & identified key features
